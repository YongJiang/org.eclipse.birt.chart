<p>Contains classes that define a rendering notification that is interpreted by 
a device renderer. Also contains a convenient cache for reusing primitive event 
rendering notifications that are rendered immediately (as opposed to rendering 
into a deferred cache and the rendering order sorted based on a Z-order). Each 
event encapsulates source information and several arguments needed for correctly 
rendering a given primitive.</p>
<p>The class <code>PrimitiveRenderingEvent</code> represents the base class from which all 
events are subclassed.</p>
