<p>Contains a default out-of-the-box set of series type interfaces that are 
associated with all charts. Series types may be associated with either 'charts 
with axes' or 'charts without axes'. Each series could be used standalone by 
itself in a chart or as a mixed combination with other series types that may be 
combined. Some series types are defined as stackable when rendered.</p>
