<p>Represents the chart model implementation classes that define the starting 
point for creating a new chart. Once an instance is created (using the 
appropriate <code>create(...)</code> method) use the corresponding interface reference to 
manipulate the instance. This package also provides a convenience class to 
serialize and de-serialize the chart model into an XML representation.</p>
