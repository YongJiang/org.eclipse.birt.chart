<p>Provides interfaces and no-op adapters that define services 
provided by the device renderer and an associated display server. A device 
renderer is responsible for rendering a chart on a device-specific context (e.g. 
an image into a JPEG file). A display server is responsible for providing 
device-specific metrics needed to build charts and compute preferred sizes of 
the various chart components.</p>
