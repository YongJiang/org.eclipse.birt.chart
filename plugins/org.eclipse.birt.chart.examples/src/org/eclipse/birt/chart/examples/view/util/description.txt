	</Percent Stacked Area>
	<Pie>
		Pie charts show values as slices of a pie. The size of each slice is proportional to the value it represents. Pie charts for multiple series are plotted as multiple pies, one for each series.
	</Pie>
	<Standard Meter>
		Standard Meter charts contain a single dial with region(s). The background of the dial can be divided into regions with different colors.
	</Standard Meter>
	<Super Imposed Meter>
		Super imposed Meter charts contain multiple dials with identical regions. The dials overlap together so that it can represent multiple needles within a single region.
	</Super Imposed Meter>
	<Scatter>
		Scatter charts show the values arranged on the plot using the category and value data as co-ordinates. Each data value is indicated by a marker.
	</Scatter>
	<Bar Stick Stock>
		A bar-stick stock chart contains a vertical line with two horizontal lines sticking to it. The upper and lower points of the vertical line are the stock open and close values. The two horizontal lines are the high and low values.
	</Bar Stick Stock>
	<Candle Stick Stock>
		A candle-stick stock chart contains a box with lines extending up and down from the ends. The upper and lower edges of the box are the stock open and close values. The upper and lower points of the line are the high and low values. 
	</Candle Stick Stock>
